# Server Output

The output contains the same directories that were given to AllosMod and
subdirectories for each simulation. Each subdirectory will contain a MODELLER
script (model_run.py), a unique starting structure (random.ini), a restraint
file containing interactions that will define the energy landscape
(converted.rsr), log files, and other output files.

# To run the simulation

To run, navigate to a run directory. Each run directory contains a unique
starting structure (random.ini) and a unique run script (model_run.py).
Type: "python model_run.py > model_run.log" to run it. The script will output
2000 snapshots by default (numbered 1001 to 3000) as well other data files.
AllosMod implements the automodel class used in MODELLER for comparative
modeling, although the optimization and refinement steps have been modified
to allow for constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations. For each
run directory, there is a file allosmod.py. This file contains the ConstTemp
class that controls the simulation schedule and temperature (MDtemp).
For help with script details, refer to the MODELLER help pages
(http://salilab.org/modeller/manual/).

# To analyze the simulation

Download the analysis script to run on any linux/unix based machine
(http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/analysis.zip).
This script will check the simulations for possible errors as well as output
several files including: 1) energies 2) Boltzmann weighted probabilities
3) local structural similarity metrics Qi. See README file for a full
description.
